# im-queue

This is a test repo to test different approaches to a distributed work queue.

To be as simple as possible, the task will be to simply effect a sum, where incoming events will be simple integers.

- Simple sum (async code)
- Using promises
- putting the work into memory
- putting the work into MySQL/Postgres
- putting the work into redis
- putting the work into RabbitMQ
- Multiple workers (concurrency)
